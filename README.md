# Developer Marketing & DevRel Links

Have you seen anything worth checking related to developer relations recently? Or maybe something on developer marketing? It seems like there's a ton of really valuable resources out there, but in order to learn about their existence, in most cases you need to embark on an ongoing exploration quest, to eventually find them organically.

Quality of such content is always very subjective, I know. And it's not possible to compile everything. But, what if we can build such knowledge base together, gradually?
